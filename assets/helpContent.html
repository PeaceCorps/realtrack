<h3>Getting Started with RealTrack</h3>
</div>
<ol>

<li>To get started, click on "My Projects" and create a primary project. (Example - Youth Development)

<p><li>Now create a repeating activity within your project and fill in some details relevant to all instances of that activity. Set a reminder to record participation/notes. (Example - If your Youth Group Meets every Monday and Thursday afternoon, set a reminder on those evenings to record participation)

<p><li>Each time your activity takes place, use the orange "People" button to record it and add notes. (Example - Each time your youth group meets you would enter the number of participants and any other details.)

<p><li>You can also bring your device to events and let participants sign-in electronically. Click on date and time. Have your participants sign-in on the tablet with their name, age, gender and signature. This will give you an official record of the event.

<p><li>You can create secondary projects and other activities as needed by clicking on the + icon on the upper right or on "Add a Secondary Project...".

<p><li>View graphs of your participation data by clicking on "My Data" from the home screen.

<p><li> Export all of your data into a spreadsheet and email it or send it by bluetooth to yourself to use when filling out the VRF by clicking on "My Data" and then the share icon on the top right. This will also send you a PDF of any sign in sheets that you created.
