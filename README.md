This is a project started at the [*Random Hacks of Kindness*](http://www.rhok.org/event/atlanta-ga-usa-1) (part of the [National Civic Day of Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/)) event at Atlanta, GA on 6/1-2/2013.

**RealTrack** is an Android smartphone application designed to facilitate day-to-day data collection by Peace Corps Volunteers (PCV) in the field. This app is based on an [idea](http://www.rhok.org/problems/realtrack-app) suggested by Julia Schulkers, who is a Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand, for the [Peace Corps Innovation Challenge](innovationchallenge.peacecorps.gov).

Essentially, the problem we're aiming to tackle is that PCVs currently use a 22-page long pen and paper-based "Activity and Outcome Tracking booklet" to keep track of their day-to-day activities in the field. Data collection is vital to

* gauging the effectiveness of volunteers
* gauging the effectiveness and usage of funding by various governmental entities for Peace Corps tasks
* engender a sense of accomplishment among the volunteers, who can look back at data collected after their term of service

Some examples of data collected by volunteers is

* the number of students taught in a class
* the number of local leaders contacted

The problem with tracking data on paper is that if the volunteer's tasks are outside or some distance from their homes (very common), and they forget to carry the paper with them, data for that day is lost. As it happens, this is a very common occurrence and volunteers often omit to record data meticulously, leading them to reconstruct data from memory (and thus creating inaccurate records).

Using a smartphone application to track data is a good idea because most volunteers own iOS or Android-based smartphones and carry them with themselves wherever they go. Smartphone apps can also remind you if you forget to make a note or record data on a given day. Smartphones also raise the possibility of making richer records e.g. by using the smartphone's camera to add images to the records being kept.

Here are some of the proposed features of the application:

* Streamlined interface
* Automatic report generation of data emailed to user on demand (so available on a PC)
* Reminders to record data for activities making sure the PCV doesn't forget
* Recording meetings with local leaders
* Tweets to engender sense of accomplishment
* Ability to share images from phone’s gallery
