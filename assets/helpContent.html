<h3>Getting Started with RealTrack</h3>
</div>
<ol>

<li>To get started, click on “My Projects” and create a primary project. (Example – Youth Development)

<p><li>Now create a repeating activity within your project and fill in some details relevant to all instances of that activity. Set a reminder to record participation/notes. (example – If English Classes recur every Monday and Thursday afternoon, set a reminder on those evenings to record participation)

<p><li>When participants come to an activity, use the green “People” button to record it and add notes. (Example – each time you taught an English Class you would enter the number of participants and any other details.)

<p><li>If you like, you can bring your tablet to events and let participants sign-in electronically. Click on date and time and they’ll automatically put the current time but don’t worry, if you forget to record an event, you can always go back later. Have your participants sign-in on the tablet with their name, age, gender and signature (this is where it gets interesting!)

<p><li>Each time you hold your activity, use the “People” button to record participation.

<p><li>You can create secondary projects and other activities as needed by clicking on the + icon on the upper right or on 'Add a Secondary Project...".

<p><li>View an organized list of all your data by clicking on “My Data” from the home screen.

<p><li> Export your data into a spreadsheet and email it to yourself to use when filling out the VRF by clicking on the My Data and then the email icon on the top right. This will also send you a PDF of everyone who attended and their signatures (cool!)
