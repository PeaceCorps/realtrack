#### Background
This is a project started at the [*Random Hacks of Kindness*](http://www.rhok.org/event/atlanta-ga-usa-1) (part of the [National Civic Day of Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/)) event at Atlanta, GA on 6/1-2/2013.

**RealTrack** is an Android smartphone application designed to facilitate day-to-day data collection by Peace Corps Volunteers (PCV) in the field. This app is based on an [idea](http://www.rhok.org/problems/realtrack-app) suggested by Julia Schulkers, who is a Peace Corps Volunteer in Thailand, for the [Peace Corps Innovation Challenge](innovationchallenge.peacecorps.gov).

#### Notes for Developers
You will need the [ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/download.html) and [PagerSlidingTabStrip](https://github.com/astuetz/PagerSlidingTabStrip) libraries set up in your workspace to work on RealTrack. [Here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/15244538/611888) is a brief guide on setting up ActionBarSherlock if you're having problems. PagerSlidingTabStrip has directions in its github readme.

You will also need an Android Support v7 GridLayout project in your workspace. [This](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/features.html#v7-gridlayout) page will give you details on where to find the source in the SDK as well as setting it up in Eclipse.

Note that all these projects should be set up as *library projects* in Eclipse.

#### External Library Dependencies
* ActionBarSherlock
* iText-Android PDF
* PagerSlidingTabStrip
